## What I did (needed for submission)

I implemented the `ArriveController.java` and the `SeekController.java` files. These two classes are responsible for the car behavior in the `ArriveScenario.java` & `SeekScenario.java`, respectively. I also implemented the `Vector.java` class to handle the calculations needed in the controllers. In the controllers I implemented the `update()` functions that are responsible for getting the steering behaviors and applying output filtering to get the desired car behavior according to the algorithms covered in class (seek & arrive).
