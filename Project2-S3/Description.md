## What I did (needed for submission)

I completed the `src/ai/Astar.java` class. In this class i created a private class `Node` that would be used to traverse through the landscape using Astar. This class hold the coordinates for each node (x and y), its f score, g score, hscore, and its parent node. It also implements the comparable interface so that my priority queue could sort based on the fscore (`compareTo()` and `equals()` function being overridden). With this in place I can create nodes for each coordinate and traverse through the map. I add the start position to my open list (priority queue) and start looping to find the best path. I used manhattan distance as my heuristic. Also checked to make sure that neighbors were valid before adding to my open list. Once the goal was reached, I reconstructed the path using the goal node and walking back through the parent nodes until a path was formed. This resulted in smooth gameplay between AI's as demonstrated in the video below.
