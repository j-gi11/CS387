## What I did (needed for submission)

I implemented the `ObstacleAvoidanceController.java` file. This class is responsible for the car behavior in `ObstacleAvoidanceSeekScenario.java`. I also implemented the `Vector.java` class to handle the calculations needed in the controllers (copied from my part 1). In the controller I implemented the `update()` function that is responsible for getting the steering behaviors, applying output filtering, and avoiding obstacles to get the desired car behavior according to the algorithms covered in class. For avoiding obastacles I used the method reccomended by casting rays directly infront and 45 degrees to the left and right to detect collisions. This collision detection runs on every frame and casts rays in the 3 directions up until the `SAFE_DISTANCE` defined in the controller. If a collision is detected the update algorithm will update the steering behaviors and throttle accordingly. I first define the ideal steering behaviors and outputs, and then tweak them if collisions are detected. If no collisions are detected, then no additional tweaks need to be made.
